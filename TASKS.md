# COST FUNCTION

### TASKS:

1. Review basic calc concepts. (derivatives, etc.)

### NOTES:

1.  m = number of observations
    h = hypothesis is the line
    the lower the J value the better the cost function or least error according to data given

2.  [Minimized - then returned value is usually called cost, loss or error. The goal is to find the values of model parameters for which Cost Function return as small number as possible.
    Maximized - then the value it yields is named a reward. The goal is to find values of model parameters for which returned number is as large as possible. link](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-deep-learning-for-beginners-linear-regression-part-2-cost-function-49545303d29f)
